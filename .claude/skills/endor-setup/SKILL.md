# Endor Labs Setup Wizard

Guide the user from zero to scanning in 5 minutes. The MCP server runs via `npx` using the published `endorctl` npm package - no binary installation required.

## Step 1: Check Prerequisites

### 1.1 Check if Node.js is installed

Node.js v18+ is required to run the MCP server via `npx`.

```bash
node --version
```

If not installed, provide installation instructions:

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install node

# Ubuntu/Debian
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Or use nvm (recommended)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
nvm install 20
```

### 1.2 Verify npx is available

```bash
npx --version
```

npx comes bundled with Node.js. If missing, run `npm install -g npx`.

### 1.3 Quick test of endorctl via npx

```bash
npx -y endorctl --version
```

This downloads and runs endorctl without installing it globally. The `-y` flag auto-confirms the download.

## Step 2: Configure the MCP Server

### 2.1 Check if MCP server is already configured

Look for `endor-cli-tools` in the project's `.claude/settings.json`.

### 2.2 If not configured, create the settings

Create or update `.claude/settings.json` in the project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "endor-cli-tools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "endorctl",
        "ai-tools",
        "mcp-server",
        "--config-path",
        ".endorctl-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MCP_ENDOR_CONFIG_PATH": ".endorctl-mcp",
        "ENDOR_MCP_SERVER_AUTH_MODE": "google",
        "ENDOR_API": "https://api.endorlabs.com",
        "ENDOR_NAMESPACE": "demo-trial"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2.3 Create the config directory

```bash
mkdir -p .endorctl-mcp
touch .endorctl-mcp/config.yaml
```

### 2.4 Important: Restart Required

Tell the user: **You must restart Claude Code after creating or modifying settings.json for the MCP server to become available.**

## Step 3: Choose Authentication Method

Ask the user which authentication provider they use:

| Provider | `ENDOR_MCP_SERVER_AUTH_MODE` | Additional Config |
|----------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| Google | `google` | None |
| GitHub | `github` | None |
| GitLab | `gitlab` | None |
| Enterprise SSO | `sso` | Also set `ENDOR_MCP_SERVER_AUTH_TENANT` |
| Email | `email` | Also set `ENDOR_MCP_SERVER_AUTH_EMAIL` |

Update the `ENDOR_MCP_SERVER_AUTH_MODE` in settings.json accordingly.

On first MCP tool call, the server will automatically open a browser window for authentication. The token is cached for 1 hour.

### For CI/CD or headless environments

Instruct the user to set these environment variables themselves (never ask them to paste credentials into chat):

```bash
export ENDOR_API_CREDENTIALS_KEY=<your-api-key>
export ENDOR_API_CREDENTIALS_SECRET=<your-api-secret>
```

Or use a pre-existing token:

```bash
export ENDOR_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

## Step 4: Configure Namespace

### 4.1 Ask for their namespace

The namespace is their Endor Labs organization name. They can find it at [app.endorlabs.com](https://app.endorlabs.com) in the top-left corner.

### 4.2 Update settings.json

Replace `"demo-trial"` with their actual namespace in the `ENDOR_NAMESPACE` field.

If they don't have a namespace yet, `demo-trial` provides limited demo access.

### 4.3 For new users without an account

Direct them to:
- Sign up at [endorlabs.com](https://www.endorlabs.com) (free tier available)
- Or run `/endor-demo` to try with simulated data

## Step 5: Verify Setup

After restarting Claude Code, try using one of the MCP tools to verify the connection:

Use the `check_dependency_for_vulnerabilities` MCP tool with a known package:
- ecosystem: `npm`
- dependency_name: `lodash`
- version: `4.17.20`

If this returns vulnerability data, the setup is working.

If it opens a browser for authentication, that's expected on first use. Complete the login flow.

## Step 6: Success

Congratulate the user and provide next steps:

```markdown
## Setup Complete!

Your Endor Labs MCP server is configured and ready. Here's what to try:

### First Steps
1. `/endor-scan` - Scan your current project for security issues
2. `/endor-check express 4.17.1` - Check a dependency for vulnerabilities
3. `/endor-help` - See all available commands

### Daily Workflow
- Run `/endor-scan` regularly during development
- Use `/endor-check` when adding new dependencies
- Run `/endor-review` before creating pull requests

### Learn More
- `/endor-demo` - Interactive demo with sample data
- `/endor-help` - Full command reference
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `node: command not found` | Install Node.js v18+ (see Step 1) |
| `npx: command not found` | Install Node.js v18+ (npx is bundled) |
| `endorctl: not found via npx` | Check internet connection; run `npx -y endorctl --version` |
| MCP tools not showing in Claude Code | Restart Claude Code after editing settings.json |
| Browser auth not opening | Check `ENDOR_MCP_SERVER_AUTH_MODE` is set correctly |
| `namespace not found` | Verify ENDOR_NAMESPACE matches your org name at app.endorlabs.com |
| `permission denied` | Verify your account has access to the namespace |
| Timeout on first run | First `npx` run downloads the package - this may take 30-60 seconds |
| Behind a corporate proxy | Set `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable in settings.json env block |

## Available MCP Tools After Setup

Once configured, these tools are available to Claude Code:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `scan` | Scan repository for vulnerabilities, secrets, SAST issues |
| `check_dependency_for_vulnerabilities` | Check a specific package version for CVEs |
| `get_endor_vulnerability` | Get detailed CVE/GHSA vulnerability information |
| `get_resource` | Retrieve any Endor Labs resource (Project, Finding, Policy, etc.) |
